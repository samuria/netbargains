# NetBargains Frontend

This project is the frontend for NetBargains, a website for comparing Australian NBN plans.

## Description

The site is built with static HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It fetches plan data from a remote API and displays it in a filterable and sortable table.

There are two main pages:
- `index.html`: Shows all available NBN plans.
- `deals.html`: Shows only NBN plans that have a promotional deal.

## Running Locally

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Open the `index.html` or `deals.html` file directly in your web browser.

The application is configured to use a local API endpoint when run from `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`, and the production API when run from any other domain.
